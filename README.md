# A-Frame 3D Maze Project

Did somebody say maze? In this project, you'll be working with A-Frame to build an interactive 3D Maze for users to try to solve.

a-MAZE-ing!

## Instructions

Fork and Clone this repository or feel free to start from scratch. In `index.html`, use your knowledge of a-frame primitives (box, plane, etc) to build a maze that users will have to navigate through.

## Tips and Tricks

+ Draw out your maze before you start to build it. Start simple and then get more complex.

+ Texture your maze walls, floor, and sky textures.

+ Place an object (or text) at the end of the maze so that your users know that they've made it!

+ Medium Challenge: Add in special doors that will disappear when you click on them (Using the cursor and animation).

+ Advanced: Can you write an algorithm in javascript that will automatically construct a maze? And can you then have that maze translated into a-frame using jQuery?

+ Add your own quirks to your labyrinth!
